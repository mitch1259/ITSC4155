Clone the sprint-3-submission branch to your local machine

Cd into /client/, run npm install, then run npm start

Open another terminal, cd into /server/, run npm install, then run npm run devStart

In MySQL Workbench (or your SQL editor of choice), create a database called budgitdb, then run the SQL files included in the root directory of the sprint-2 branch (in the /budgitdb/ folder)

Additionally, the unit tests are located in the test folder in /server/. To run them:

Cd into /server/, run npm run devStart

Open a new terminal, cd into /server/

Run npm test and the unit tests will automatically run.
